                <p>John Doe is a 32-year-old freelance graphic designer based in Portland, Oregon. With a passion for minimalist aesthetics and typography, he spends his days crafting logos, branding materials, and digital illustrations for small businesses and startups. 
                    When he's not glued to his Adobe Creative Suite, he enjoys hiking in the Pacific Northwest, and collecting vintage vinyl records.</p>
                <p>A self-proclaimed introvert with a dry sense of humor, John prefers cozy cafés over loud bars and would rather binge-watch a documentary series than go to a crowded party. </p>
                <p>Key Traits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creative but pragmatic</li>
                    <li>Quietly observant</li>
                    <li>Low-key tech nerd</li>
                    <li>Always wearing neutral tones</li>
                </ul>

    <!-- The html code dsepicts a simple structure of a user card, with an image, a name, and a description, and a button -->
    <!-- This js code is used to show a longer description of the user when the button is clicked and it also changes 
     the content written on the button to "Hide Info" to also allow the reader to "close" the additional info after 
     they are done reading. This interactive feature is added to make the user card more engaging and user-friendly, 
     without them being bombarded with too much information at once, so they may chose if they want to see the info or not-->
